### 0.1 and 0.2
##### Probably im gonna do something related with Acceleracers and make like a story between the characters and the lore. A cool side story in a realm like the water realm or the city realm, whichever i end up using use one with a lot of public images so that i can implement them in the game.

### 0.3
##### My characters are Taro, Kadeem, Kurt, Major Wheeler, Vert Wheeler and Dr.Tezla. Ive done a basic selection screen and now i have to make the actual screen where all the lore and history are shown, where each character has its backstory slightly resumend.

### 0.3.1
##### Ive fixed some of the css stuff and the link to it.

### 0.4
##### I've added an image gallery using Javascript and CSS to show images in the character detailed explanation page.

### 0.4.1
##### I've fixed the Javascript code that wasnt working
